Fixes the Fend bug in Diablo II LoD 1.14d by disabling Dodge and Avoid animations. The skills themselves still work, and the player will hear the Amazon's "hyah" sound when they trigger. Many thanks to EnPhreg and other forum users in this thread for sharing their finds:

How to use:

    diablo2-fend-fix.exe Game.exe

The file "Game.exe" will be changed. Make a backup beforehand in case you ever want to go back. In general, please do not try to connect to Battle.net with modified game files (you might face a ban).
Game versions other than 1.14d are currently not supported.

A Windows binary is available in the Release section: https://github.com/hippie68/diablo2-fend-fix/releases.
